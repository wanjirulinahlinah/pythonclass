# 8. Add a transfer method which accepts two attributes (amount and instance of another account).
# If the amount is less than the current instances balance, the method transfers the requested
# amount from the current account to the passed account. The transfer is accomplished by
# reducing the current account balance and depositing the requested amount to the passed account.
